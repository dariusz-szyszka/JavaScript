      <h2>Quick intro to the Baltic Sea</h2>
      <section>
        <p>The Baltic Sea is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean that is enclosed by 
          Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, 
          Sweden and the North and Central European Plain.</p>
        <p>The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E 
          longitude. A marginal sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange 
          between the two water bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish 
          Straits into the Kattegat by way of the Øresund, Great Belt and Little Belt. 
          It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, 
          the Gulf of Riga and the Bay of Gdańsk.</p>
        <p>The "Baltic Proper" is bordered on its northern edge, at latitude 60°N, 
          by Åland and the Gulf of Bothnia, on its northeastern edge by the Gulf 
          of Finland, on its eastern edge by the Gulf of Riga, and in the west by 
          the Swedish part of the southern Scandinavian Peninsula.</p>
      </section>
      <h3>Administration</h3>
      <section>
        <p>The Helsinki Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of 
          the Baltic Sea Area includes the Baltic Sea and the Kattegat, without 
          calling Kattegat a part of the Baltic Sea.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
          <i>For the purposes of this 
          Convention the 'Baltic Sea Area' shall be the Baltic Sea and the Entrance 
          to the Baltic Sea, bounded by the parallel of the Skaw in the Skagerrak 
          at 57°44.43'N.</i>
        </blockquote>
      </section>
      <h3>Coastal countries</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Countries that border the sea: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, 
          Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Sweden.</p>
        <p>Countries lands in the outer drainage basin: Belarus, Czech Republic, 
          Norway, Slovakia, Ukraine.</p>
        <p>The Baltic Sea drainage basin is roughly four times the surface area 
          of the sea itself. About 48% of the region is forested, with Sweden 
          and Finland containing the majority of the forest, especially around 
          the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.</p>
        <p>About 20% of the land is used for agriculture and pasture, mainly 
          in Poland and around the edge of the Baltic Proper, in Germany, 
          Denmark, and Sweden. About 17% of the basin is unused open land with 
          another 8% of wetlands. Most of the latter are in the Gulfs of Bothnia 
          and Finland.</p>
        <p>The rest of the land is heavily populated. About 85 million people 
          live in the Baltic drainage basin, 15 million within 10 km (6 mi) of 
          the coast and 29 million within 50 km (31 mi) of the coast. Around 22 
          million live in population centers of over 250,000. 90% of these are 
          concentrated in the 10 km (6 mi) band around the coast. Of the nations 
          containing all or part of the basin, Poland includes 45% of the 85 
          million, Russia 12%, Sweden 10% and the others less than 6% each.</p>
