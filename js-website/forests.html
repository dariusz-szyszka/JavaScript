      <h2>Quick intro to the forests of Poland</h2>
      <section>
        <p>Forests cover an estimated 35% of Poland's territory, and are mostly 
          owned by the state. And are increasing at a fast rate by 2035 Polands 
          forest percentage will be 40-42%. Western and northern parts of Poland 
          as well as the Carpathian Mountains in the extreme south, are much more 
          forested than eastern and central provinces. The most forested 
          administrative districts of the country are: Lubusz Voivodeship (60,2%), 
          Subcarpathian Voivodeship (58,2%), and Pomeranian Voivodeship (50,1%). 
          The least forested are: Łódź Voivodeship (36,0%), Masovian Voivodeship 
          (34,6%), and Lublin Voivodeship (32,8%).</p>

      <h3>Contemporary history</h3>
      <section>
        <p>At the end of the 18th century, forests covered around 40% of Poland. 
          However, due to the 19th century economic exploitation during the 
          partitions of Poland, as well as, the Nazi German and Soviet occupations 
          between 1939–1945 with trees shipped to battle fronts across Europe, 
          deforestation and slash and burn conditions of war shrank Polish 
          forests to only 21% of total area of the country (as of 1946). 
          Furthermore, rich deciduous trees were replaced with fast growing 
          coniferous trees of lesser value meant for commerce, such as pine. 
          After World War II, the government of Poland initiated the National 
          Plan of Afforestation. By 1970, forests covered 29% of the country. 
          As of 2009 – 29,1% of Poland's territory was forested, amounting to 
          9,088,000 hectares. It is estimated that by 2050, the total area of 
          forested land should increase to 33%.</p>
        <p>As much as 81,8% of the Polish forests are state-owned, majority 
          (77,8%) by Polish State Forests (Lasy Państwowe), 2% constitute 
          Polish National Forests protected zones, 2% are owned by other 
          governmental entities (such as local self-government or the 
          Agricultural Property Agency) and 18,2% belong to private owners. 
          The high percentage of Polish forests owned by the state is the 
          result of nationalization of forests that occurred in the aftermath 
          of World War II when Poland became a communist state (see People's 
          Republic of Poland) under the Soviet sphere of influence.</p>
